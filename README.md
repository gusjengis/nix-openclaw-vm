I'm using the bootstapping that I already have working for my personal NixOS setup as base for my OpenClaw VM project. If you're coming here from my resume, this is something that will be working soon enough. I've tested the pieces in isolation, it's just a matter of putting them together.


This is an install script to quickly retore my setup on NixOS. It assumes you've just done a fresh, no desktop install, using the graphical installer iso. I haven't tested it with other setups.

Instructions:

1. Use the graphical installer to install NixOs
    - https://nixos.org/download/
    - Set the name to `Anthony Green`
    - Set the user to `gusjengis`
    - Use the same password for both the user and root
    - Choose the "No Desktop" option

2. After booting:
    - Login as `gusjengis`
    - Use nmtui to connect to the network
    - Run the following command:
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gusjengis/nix-install-script/main/install.sh | bash -s -- gusjengis
    ```
    - Select the modules you want to enable in the prompts

3. After the script finishes, reboot the system. You should boot straight into the desktop. Or just a TTY depending on the selected modules.
4. If not in TTY, open the terminal with SUPER+T
5. Run ```gh auth login``` to authenticate git with GitHub   
6. Run ```sync``` to pull all missing repos 
7. Reboot and get to work!

P.S. Don't forget to set a name in the tailscale dashboard! And you still need to sign in to stuff.
